# Big O Notation
- Whats the need for Big O ?
  - imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function, how do we decide what is the best solution?
    - using Big O can tell us what the most performant solution would be
  - this matters when working with large amounts of data
  - useful in discussing the tradeoffs between different solutions
  - important to understand which parts of your code might be slowing things down
- See `big_o.js` for practice example of time complexity of a simple problem
- The problem with time:
  - different machines will record different times
  - the same machine can record different times
  - for fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough
