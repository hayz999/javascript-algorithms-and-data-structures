# Problem solving patterns

## Frequency counter pattern
- this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- this can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings
- see `frequency_counter.js` for examples

## Multiple pointers
- creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition
- very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well
- see `multiple_pointers.js` for examples

## Sliding Window
- this pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
- depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
- very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
- see `sliding_window.js` for an example

## Divide and Conquer
- this pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
- this pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
